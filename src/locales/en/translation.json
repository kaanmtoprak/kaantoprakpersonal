    "bio": "I am a Senior Frontend Developer who has been primarily working with React and Next.js in recent years, building internal dashboards, e-commerce platforms and admin applications. I focus on micro-frontend architectures (Webpack Module Federation), reusable component-based structures and performance-oriented user interfaces. I work closely with product, design and backend teams to translate business needs into technical solutions, and I take responsibility both in project setup and in production deployment processes (Microsoft Azure). I care about code quality, readability and sustainable architecture, and I aim to create long-term value in every project I contribute to.",
